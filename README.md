This was made by following the free code camp tutorial at the following link

**ðŸ‘Œ_Highly recommended if you want get better at OOP_**

what i did additionally:
- i addded some of my own features into it. (health bar, power ups, etc)
- i made the code as CLEAN as i could understand

so this code is not a one to one match of the original project. If you want the original project you might as well watch the video ðŸ˜‚

this project was done using vanilla javascript mainly, and also some html and css. So if you want to try this out,
- clone this repositry
- open up the project9.html file and thats it !
